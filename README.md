# _buildspaceNFTProject
Programmatically generate your own NFT collection, write + deploy a smart contract in Solidity, and build your own React dApp to let friends connect their wallets and interact w/ your NFTs.

# Hardhat Info

This project presents a basic Hardhat use case. In the \_buildspace course we used Hardhat to test and deploy our contracts via short deploy scripts. I still have more to learn about Hardhat, but I can navigate builds using the basic syntax:

`npx hardhat run scripts/run.js`
and
`npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network rinkeby`

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
